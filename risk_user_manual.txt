To run the game, double click on the jar file that is in the provided zipped folder or execute it in the command line. This will open
a dialog box that will ask you how many players will be playing in the game. After typing your number and pressing ok the game will open,
showing the map with colored buttons on each country, the player with the current turn, and each player name.

The color of a button represents which player owns that country, and the number on the button represents how many troops are in that country.
To know which color you are, each player name is written in their color at the bottom of the screen. The top of the screen says whose turn it is,
also written in their color. At the top of the screen there is also a pass button that you press when you are done your turn, and a cancel attack
button which deselects the country you are attacking with.

To attack, press the button on the country you want to attack with. A dialog box will open saying which country you are attacking with.
After closing the dialog box, press the button on the country you want to attack. A dialog box will open saying which country you are
attacking. After closing the dialog box, a new dialog box will open that will either tell the attacking player how many dice they will use
or ask the attacking player how many dice they want to use. After entering the number adhering to risk rules, if necessary, and closing the
dialog box, the same process will occur for the defending player. Once the defending player closes their dialog box, the first result of the
attack will be shown in a new dialog box, followed by the remaining results. The buttons of the two countries will change numbers according
to the result of the attack, and the defending country button might change color to the attacking player's color if it was defeated.

Once the player is done attacking, press pass to give control of the game to the next player. The text above the map will change to
say the next player's name, written in their color. When a player is eliminated, a dialog box will open saying who was eliminated.
When someone has won the game, a dialog box will open saying who won the game. When this dialog box is closed, the game closes and stops
executing.

Note: the jar file might make the map larger than it should be, so the map is cut off at the bottom and the bottom panel is not visible, but all
the buttons are visible. To make the bottom panel visible make the frame full screen. If the game is run in intellij the frame looks as it should.
