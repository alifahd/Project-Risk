To run the game, double click on the jar file that is in the provided zipped folder. This will open a terminal which will ask you
how many players will be playing in the game. To choose the number of players, type a number next to the question and press enter.

At this point, the game will evenly distribute the countries among the players, and each player's troops among their countries.
Player 1 has the first turn, and they will type their command next to the ">" in the terminal. There are three commands
the player can type: "state", "pass", and "attack defendingCountry attackingCountry".
	- "state" prints the name of the country, the owner of the country, and the number of troops in the country for each country in the map.
	- "pass" ends the current player's turn and passes control of the game to the next player. The next player will be notified that it is
	  their turn.
	- "attack defendingCountry attackingCountry" attacks the country denoted defendingCountry from the country denoted attackingCountry.
	  Type the country names identically as they appear when the state of the game is shown.
	  If the attacking country has at least 3 troops, the attacking player will be prompted to choose the number of dice they want to roll.
	  Type the number next to ">" and press enter to make your decision.
	  If the defending country has at least 2 troops, the defending player will be prompted to choose the number of dice they want to roll.
	  Input your decision in the same manner as for the attacking player.
	  The outcome of the attack will be shown and then the current player will be prompted for a new command.
	  When a country is captured, a message will appear and all but 1 troop from the attacking country will be moved to the captured country.
Do not type the quotation marks when typing the command.

When a player is eliminated from the game, a message indicating this will appear and they will not have any more turns. When a player has won the game
a message will appear and the game will close.
